The algorithm was founded by Joseph Bernard Kruskal, Jr for the ‘Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society’.

Kruskal’s algorithm is a method for producing a minimal spanning tree from a weighted graph. The version used to generate a maze is a randomised version of this algorithm. The original algorithm works in the following way:
1.	Put all edges in a data structure.
2.	Choose the edge with the lowest weight.
	a.	If the edge connects 2 disjointed trees, join the trees.
	b.	Otherwise, disregard that edge.
3.	Repeat until there are no more edges.

The randomised version of the algorithm would only change the second step. Instead of choosing the edge with the lowest weight, the edge is chosen at random. This changes the process to the following:
1.	Put all edges in data structure.
2.	Choose a random edge.
	a.	If the edge connects 2 disjointed trees, join the trees.
	b.	Otherwise, disregard that edge.
3.	Repeat until there are no more edges.
